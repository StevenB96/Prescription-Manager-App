                # - "client_credentials": For server-to-server authentication without user involvement.

                # - "client_secret_jwt": Client signs a JWT with its secret and sends it for authentication.
                # - "private_key_jwt": Client signs a JWT using a private key (more secure, used in confidential clients).
                # - "none": Public clients that cannot keep a secret (used for SPAs or mobile apps with PKCE).
